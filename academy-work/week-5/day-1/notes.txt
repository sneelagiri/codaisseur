Normalization 
Take for example a players table.
First Names and Last names would go in one table
Team Color, City, Coaches, and Ratings would go in an another table. 

All values in the second table would be associated with teams and all values in the first table would be linked to the players.

What if a player is in two teams?
1. In a third table, we can have players, team ID One, team ID Two, and we can match based on that.
